# enigma
### enigma is an improved and stronger version of the spyware [blxr](https://github.com/blueshark42/blxr), which I made during the summer of 2020. 

This version is newer and has some code that wasn't working properly fixed. It has also planned a few new features and can contact a C&C style server.
Don't be stupid and don't use the code for any malicious purposes. I'm doing this to learn more about cybersecurity and malware, not to distribute.

Currently implemented:
- Keylogging and logging system info
- Creating files, folders and screenshots
- Registry Persistence
- Check for VMWare and if a debugger is present

Hopefully implemented in the future: 
- Scan for open ports
- Encrypt strings and attempt to hide more from static analysis
- Run as Windows service

- Ability to take commands from a C&C server
