ENIGMA SPYWARE

High Priority:
- Send keylog char* data to botnet

Medium Priority:
- Scan for open ports instead of forcefully opening a new one
- SYN flood DDOS attack

Low Priority:
- Encrypt string and other data so they cannot be checked in a debugger and Wireshark
- Run as windows service
- Check if a debugger is present
